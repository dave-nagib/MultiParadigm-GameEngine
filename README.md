# Scala Board Game Engine

- Implementation of a purely functional game engine capable of running any one of six board games: Chess, Connect 4, 8 Queens, Tic Tac Toe, Sudoku, and Checkers. 

- The game engine is designed to only be resposible for drawing the board, enforcing game rules, alternating turns, and validating user input. But it can be easily extended to add win conditions and score systems.

- We added some Prolog files which can solve single-player puzzle games like Sudoku & 8 Queens. The Prolog code is linked with the Scala engine to provide the user with ability to solve the puzzle at any solveable state.
